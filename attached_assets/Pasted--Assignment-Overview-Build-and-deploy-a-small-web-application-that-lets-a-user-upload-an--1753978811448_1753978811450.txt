# Assignment

### Overview

Build and deploy a small web application that lets a user upload an image of a building of any Indian house, generate segmentation masks via the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), and interactively display those masks, allowing the user to select walls of the buildings and paint them with some options of colors. The user should also be able to download the final version

This is how the flow should look like from an end user’s perspective:

- Go to website, upload an image
- The image gets processed and masks get generated
- The user can click anywhere on the image and a mask should appear there.
- The user can shift click and combine masks to make a bigger mask, ideally covering one of the walls of the building
- The user selects a color from the color pallete and clicks apply to apply that color on that wall, not changing anything else in the building.
- The user will color multiple areas in different colors and then click a download button to download the final image.

You are free to use any stack / technology for frontend, backend or your cloud provider where you will deploy this frontend and backend pieces. The SAM2 GPU section will be deployed on any GPU services (see end of this document).

### Functional Requirements

- **Image Upload**
    - A button or drag-and-drop zone to select an image from disk
    - Preview the uploaded image immediately
- **Generate Masks**
    - A “Generate Masks” button that requests mask generation from backend
    - Show a loading indicator while masks are being created
- **Interactive Mask Overlay**
    - When the user clicks anywhere on the image, fetch & display the mask corresponding to that point as a semi-transparent overlay
    - Allow toggling mask visibility on/off
    - Give a toggle to see ALL the masks that were generated by the system.
    - Allow the user to add to the mask selection or removing using shift click and shift right click
- **Color Visualization**
    - Allow the user to color one or multiple masks and apply the colors such that only the selected section gets colored
    - Allow the user to download the final colored image.

### Deliverables

- Final links for the frontend, preferably a link to view the API docs of the backend.
- GitHub repository with proper documentation and CI/CD setup for auto deployment and running tests (if any)

### Timeline

- **Suggested time:** 3-4 days

### Notes

- To run the SAM model, you’ll need to host the code and run it on a GPU. There are many services which offer this feature and provide some free credits. Feel free to use any of them. Some of them are listed below:
